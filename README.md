## 🤔 Who am I and where I come from  
- I am a French high school student, who like to programs things in his free time😉  
#### 🤩 <ins>My beginnings</ins>
- I have began this passion at the age of 12 (2017). My first experience in this world was HTML/PHP/CSS. After that I quickly switch to making games with unity in C#. I loved it so much that I decided to do a [summer school](https://www.isart.fr/summer-school/code-jeu-video-2d/). After that I stuck a bit with video games but felt quickly bored and wanting to learn new things but didn't really knowing what. I was young and liked more playing games then making some. But during lock down I started to interest my self again to programming.
#### ⛏🧱 <ins>Minecraft</ins>
- One day as I was playing Minecraft I saw a group of people searching a programmer for their server (if don't know what a server is, it's a place were players can play together) and thot to my self I know who to code in C# it will be easy for my to code in java (they are very similar). And that's how I joined [Helevtis](http://play.helvetis.net/helvetis/index.html)
#### 🥰 <ins>Helvetis</ins>
- I joined this project at the begging of may 2020 and it's still going! 😄  
- In this project we were 5: Wrench: the system admin; Koordan: the builder; Sweet: the organizer; Clim: the modarator; and me!
- Our goal with this server was to attract as much players.
- After joining this project I quickly become Administrator and managed the server with these 4 complete stranger. I also learned how to attract players this not only gave me the role of programmer but also community manager and more generaly administrator.
- Through out these years I have met a lot of people from all over the world thank to this project, some were nice some not so...
- This project really means a lot to me these 4 stranger became my online familly. We were so close that we even met in real life! 🥳
- Thank to this project I learn java and especially Spigot library. I also learned SLQ and how to manage data bases.

- SpigotMC is a forum for related stuff to Minecraft and espacially plugins (a plugin is an extention of the original game)
<!---
- On this forum I sold my knowledge 
- Now I am selling plugins
